0x00. C - Hello, World
Introduction to programming and first set of assignments at Holberton School

What you should learn from this project

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
Why C programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
Who invented C
Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
What happens when you type gcc main.c
What is an entry point
What is main
How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
How to compile using gcc
What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
How does the main function influence the return value of the program
Exercises
0-preprocessor

Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor
and save the result into another file.
The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output should be saved in the file c
1-compiler

Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
2-assembler

Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in
an output file.
The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
4-puts.c

Write a C program that prints exactly
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
Use the function puts
You are not allowed to use printf
Your program should end with the value 0
3-name

Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
5-printf.c

Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is
a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
Use the function printf
You are not allowed to use the function puts
Your program should return 0
Your program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc option
6-size.c

Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is
compiled and run on.
You should produce the exact same output as in the example
Warnings are allowed
Your program should return 0
You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux (Vagrant) to test the -m32 gcc option
100-intel

Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and
save it in an output file.
The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
101-quote.c

Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful"
- Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts
Your program should return 1
Your program should compile without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option
Full Stack Software Engineer
=======
A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture—commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. Generally this refers to either machine code or assembly language. The word "low" refers to the small or nonexistent amount of abstraction between the language and machine language; because of this, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable

About
At Holberton School, there are several tracks to become a full stack software engineer. One of those tracks is the low level programming track which covers the following:

Compilation
Commenting code and following a coding style standard
Variables, types, operators, expressions, loops, nested loops
Conditional statements
Functions
Pre-processor, macros, header files, pointers, double pointers, function pointers, pointer arithmetic
Makefiles
Sorting and search algorithms and more!
Requirements
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
gcc 4.8.4 (-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic flags)
